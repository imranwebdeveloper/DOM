                Action Center lists important messages about security and
                maintenance settings that need your attention. Red items in
                Action Center are labeled Important, and indicate significant
                issues that should be addressed soon, such as an outdated
                antivirus program that needs updating. Yellow items are
                suggested tasks that you should consider addressing, like
                recommended maintenance tasks.

                If you'd like Windows to install important updates as they
                become available, turn on automatic updating. Important updates
                provide significant benefits, such as improved security and
                reliability. You can also set Windows to automatically install
                recommended updates, which can address noncritical problems and
                help enhance your computing experience. Optional updates are not
                downloaded or installed automatically. To learn more about the
                types of updates that Microsoft publishes, go to this Knowledge
                Base article on the Microsoft Help and Support website.

                When you are logged on to Windows with a standard account, you
                can do almost anything that you can do with an administrator
                account, but if you want to do something that affects other
                users of the computer, such as installing software or changing
                security settings, Windows might ask you to provide a password
                for an administrator account.
